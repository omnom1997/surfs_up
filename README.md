# Surfs Up Analysis

## Overview of Analysis

Our initial task was to perform an analysis on weather data for O'ahu for our investor, W. Avy, as we are trying to open a surfboard and ice cream shop on the island. W. Avy wanted us to analyze the weather data he found to prevent our surf shop from being rained out much like his surf shop was. W. Avy appreciated our analysis, but he requested more information about temperature trends before opening our surfboard and ice cream shop. He specifically requested the temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business will be sustainable year-round. 

## Results

- There are 183 fewer temperature readings for December than there were in June.
- Generally, we can conclude from the June and December statistics that December was cooler than June.
- There is generally the temperature for December varied more than the temperature for June.

## Summary 
Based on the statistical analysis that we performed on the weather data that W. Avy provided, December is generally cooler than June. From this, we can extrapolate that demand for surfboards and ice cream should decrease in December.

While the general trends show that the temperature falls in Hawaii during December, it would be helpful to see what the precipitation trends are in June and December. This would help us confirm if we can expect the demand for surfboards and ice cream to decrease in December.

The queries that would help us to determine this are included below:


There is a high-level summary of the results and there are two additional queries to perform to gather more weather data for June and December. To get just the Oahu stations, we would use the following queries:
